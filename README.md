# Personal Assignment 1

## Objective

Create a small **web-based calculator** that takes personal data as input, processes it using a formula of your choice, and displays output.  

This task will help you understand:

- Variables  
- Conditional logic (`if/else`)  
- Input → Process → Output flow  

You are free to choose the type of calculation, but it should be **realistic, measurable, and meaningful**.

---

## Assignment Guidelines

### Allowed Technologies

- **HTML** — for form inputs and output display  
- **CSS** — for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** — for logic, calculations, and output  

---

### Input Requirements

Your calculator should take **at least two inputs** from the user. Examples:

- Weight & height → BMI  
- Power & hours → Electricity cost  
- Distance & time → Pace  
- Any other real-world values you choose  

> You are encouraged to **think creatively**. Inputs should be measurable and realistic.

---

### Process Requirements

Your JavaScript must:

- Store input values in **variables**  
- Perform **at least one calculation**  
- Use **if/else conditions** to classify or interpret results  
- You may define your **own calculation formula**, or use a known index like BMI  

---

### Output Requirements

Your page must:

- Display output **directly in HTML** (not just console)  
- Include a **personalized message** (e.g., “Hello, [Name]”)  
- Show **calculated value(s)**  
- Show **category or interpretation** if relevant

### Submission Instructions

1. **Fork** this repository  
2. Create a new branch:  
3. Complete your assignment in the four files:  
- `index.html`  
- `style.css`  
- `script.js`  
- `README.md` (update with your description or notes if needed)  
4. Commit & push your branch to your GitHub fork  
5. Be ready for an **oral explanation** of your solution  

---

### Evaluation & Oral Assessment

During the oral assessment, you should be able to explain:

- What each input represents  
- How calculations are done  
- How conditional logic determines categories  
- What happens if inputs are unusual  
- How binary or optional output is calculated  

> ⚠️ **Important AI Guidance:**  
> You **may use AI tools** for suggestions or syntax help, but you must **fully understand and be able to explain every line** of your code.  
> The **logic, calculations, and outputs must be your own work** — AI is a helper, not a replacement.

---

### Creativity & Flexibility

- You may choose a different calculation than BMI, Electricity, or Pace  
- You may add **extra outputs or optional features**  
- You may **style your page creatively**  

> The goal is **computational thinking, problem-solving, and clear input → process → output understanding**.

---

### Your Submission Should Include

- `index.html` → form placeholder for user inputs and output  
- `style.css` → styling for the page  
- `script.js` → JavaScript file for calculations and logic  
- `README.md` → clear explanation of your project and description of your solution
