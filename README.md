# Dog age calculator - project explanation

## Problem

Many people want to know their dog’s age in human years. **Most people use a simple rule: One dog year = seven human years.**

But this method is a myth and it is not accurate.
Dogs grow very fast in the first years of life and slower later. So the ×7 method gives wrong results.
This task will help you understand:

## Solution
My project is a Dog Age Calculator.
This calculator helps people find a more realistic dog age.
The user enters:
- Name
- Dog age
- Dog size

Then the program calculates the dog’s age in human years.
The calculator also shows:
- The result
- A dog picture
- A quote

## Calculation method
The calculator uses a method similar to the method of the
American Veterinary Medical Association.

The formula is:
1 year = 15 human years
2 years = 24 human years

After that:
**Human age = 24 + (Dog age − 2) × number**

Where:
Small dog = x4
Medium dog = x5
Large dog = x6
This method is more realistic than the ×7 method.

## How the program works

The program works in three steps:
**Input → Process → Output**

**Input**
The user enters:
- Name
- Age
- Size
- Process

**JavaScript:**
Saves values in variables
Checks if the age is correct

For example:
- If age is negative → error
- If age is more than 16 → error
Then the program calculates the age.

**Output**
The program shows:
Greeting
Example:
- Hello Anna
- Dog age

Example:
Dog age is 40 human years

## Use of AI tools

The idea and research for this project were done by me.
I researched how dog age is calculated and learned that the 7-year rule is a myth.
I studied a more realistic method and used it in my calculator.

I used ChatGPT to help me write the code because I was not familiar with programming before.
I described what I wanted to create and asked for help with the code. 

I used AI as a tool, but I understand how my program works and I can explain the code.
